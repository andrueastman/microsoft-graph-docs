# What's new in Microsoft Graph

Did you know some new features in Microsoft Graph originate as popular requests from the developer community? 

The Microsoft Graph team regularly evaluates customer needs and releases new features in the following order:

1. Debut in **_preview_** status. Any related REST API updates are in the beta endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta`).  

2. Promoted to **_general availability_ (GA)** status, if sufficient feedback indicates viability. Any related REST API updates are added to the v1.0 endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`). 

Below, see highlights of what's new in Microsoft Graph, and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For details of API updates, see the [August](changelog.md#august-2019) and [July](changelog.md#july-2019) sections of the API changelog. 


## July 2019: New and generally available 

### Example code snippets
There are now Objective-C code snippets in all API topics in the v1.0 and beta references. See the Objective-C example for [getting an event](/graph/api/event-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=objective-c#example).

### Group
- Use the [validateProperties](/graph/api/group-validateproperties?view=graph-rest-1.0) function to make sure the display name or mail nickname of an existing Office 365 group complies with naming policies.
- Alternatively, before creating the group, you can use the [validateProperties](/graph/api/directoryobject-validateproperties?view=graph-rest-1.0) function for a [directoryObject](/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-1.0) to validate the names first.

### Identity and access
- Use [new delegated and application permissions](permissions-reference.md#organization-permissions), _Organization.Read.All_ and _Organization.ReadWrite.All_, to access an [organization](/graph/api/resources/organization?view=graph-rest-1.0) and related resources such as [subscribed SKUs](/graph/api/resources/subscribedsku?view=graph-rest-1.0).
- Use [new delegated and application permissions](permissions-reference.md#role-management-permissions), _RoleManagement.Read.Directory_ and _RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory_, for role-based access control (RBAC) for your company's directory:

  - Use the read/write permission to first [activate](/graph/api/directoryrole-post-directoryroles?view=graph-rest-1.0) a directory role. 
  - With the role activated, you can use the read permission to [read directory roles](/graph/api/directoryrole-list?view=graph-rest-1.0), [list role members](/graph/api/directoryrole-list-members?view=graph-rest-1.0), and [list directory role templates](/graph/api/directoryroletemplate-list?view=graph-rest-1.0). 
  - You can also use the read/write permission to [add](/graph/api/directoryrole-post-members?view=graph-rest-1.0) and [remove](/graph/api/directoryrole-delete-member?view=graph-rest-1.0) role members.


## July 2019: New in preview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to GA status. Do not use them in production apps.

### Calendar 
Use the new [places API](/graph/api/resources/place?view=graph-rest-beta) to make use of rich location types such as [room](/graph/api/resources/room?view=graph-rest-beta) and [room list](/graph/api/resources/roomlist?view=graph-rest-beta), as set up by Exchange Online administrators.

### Devices and apps
Intune [July](changelog.md#july-2019) updates

### Files 
Apply expiration date/time or password when [creating a sharing link](/graph/api/driveitem-createlink?view=graph-rest-beta) to a file, folder, or some other [driveItem](/graph/api/resources/driveitem?view=graph-rest-beta).

### Identity and access
- Use [new application permission](/graph/permissions-reference?#accessreviews-permissions) _AccessReview.ReadWrite.Membership_ for CRUD operations on [access reviews](/graph/api/resources/accessreviews-root?view=graph-rest-beta). 
- Use [new delegated and application permissions](permissions-reference.md#administrative-units-permissions), _AdministrativeUnit.Read.All_ and _AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All_, to respectively read or write (including create, update, delete, or manage membership) [administrative unit](/graph/api/resources/administrativeunit?view=graph-rest-beta) resources.
- Use [new delegated and application permissions](permissions-reference.md#organization-permissions), _Organization.Read.All_ and _Organization.ReadWrite.All_, to access an [organization](/graph/api/resources/organization?view=graph-rest-beta) and related resources such as a [subscribed SKU](/graph/api/resources/subscribedsku?view=graph-rest-beta).
- Use the new [discover](/graph/api/directorydefinition-discover?view=graph-rest-beta) function to find the latest directory [synchronization schema](/graph/api/resources/synchronization-synchronizationschema?view=graph-rest-beta), so as to sync directory objects, attributes, and their types to an app.
- Use [feature rollout policy](/graph/api/resources/featureRolloutPolicy?view=graph-rest-beta) to help tenant administrators to pilot features to specific groups before enabling them for entire organization.

### Mail
Use more granular application permission, _Mail.ReadBasic.All_, to read a user's mailbox except for any message body, preview body, attachments, and extended properties, and except for searching the mailbox. Now applicable to [mailFolder](/graph/api/resources/mailfolder?view=graph-rest-beta) and [change tracking](delta-query-overview.md) for [message](/graph/api/resources/message?view=graph-rest-beta) and **mailFolder**.

### Reports
- Get additional [mailbox usage data](/graph/api/reportroot-getmailboxusagedetail?view=graph-rest-beta) about deleted item count and size.

### Teamwork
- [Install](/graph/api/user-add-teamsappinstallation?view=graph-rest-beta), [uninstall](/graph/api/user-delete-teamsappinstallation?view=graph-rest-beta), [upgrade](/graph/api/user-upgrade-teamsappinstallation?view=graph-rest-beta), and [list installed Microsoft Teams apps](/graph/api/user-list-teamsappinstallation?view=graph-rest-beta) for a user.
- Use app-only access to read channel messages, replies to channel messages, and messages in a chat. [Request and get approval](teams-protected-apis.md) for such access.
