# Update teamsApp

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Update an [app](../resources/teamsapp.md) previously published to the Microsoft Teams app catalog. To update an app, the **distributionMethod** property for the app must be set to `organization`.

This API specifically updates an app published to your organization's app catalog (the tenant app catalog).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

>**Note:** Only global administrators can call this API.

| Permission Type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:----------------------------------     |:-------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | AppCatalog.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (work or school account) | AppCatalog.Submit|
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported|
| Application                            | Not supported. |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /appCatalogs/teamsApps/{id}/appDefinitions
```

## Query parameters

|Property|Type|Description|
|----|----|----|
|requiresReview| Boolean | This optional query parameter triggers the app review process. Users with admin privileges can submit apps without triggering a review. If users want to request a review before publishing, they must set  `requiresReview` to `true`. A user who has admin privileges can opt not to set `requiresReview` or set the value to `false`  and the app will be considered approved and will publish instantly.|

## Request headers

| Header        | Value           |
|:--------------|:--------------  |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-Type  | application/zip. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, include a Teams zip manifest payload. For details, see [Create an app package](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/apps/apps-package)

>**Note:** Use the ID returned from the [List published apps](./teamsapp-list.md) call to reference the app you'd like to update. Do not use the ID from the manifest of the zip app package.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.
